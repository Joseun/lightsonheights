# Project Title
Source Based Fake News Classification.

# Project Description
Social media is a vast pool of content, and among all the content available for users to access, news is an element that is accessed most frequently. This news can be posted by politicians, news channels, newspaper websites, or even common civilians. These posts must be checked for their authenticity, since spreading misinformation has been a real concern in todayâ€™s times, and many firms are taking steps to make the common people aware of the consequences of spreading misinformation. The measure of authenticity of the news posted online cannot be definitively measured, since the manual classification of news is tedious and time-consuming and is also subject to bias.

## Project

This repository contains a Python Streamlit application for analyzing news data, as well as Jupyter Notebooks for building the model. It also contains with python pipelines for preprocessing, training, monitoring model inferences 

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - The framework used 
* [Mlflow](https://mlflow.org/) - For experiment tracking
* [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/opensource/) - For workflow orchestration
* [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/) - For model monitoring
